This plugin helps to change WordPress Page Permalinks structure, which is not customizable by default.

== Description ==

Converting an old HTML, PHP, or ASP site to WordPress? WP Page Extension will let you create pages inside of WordPress and give them an extension you want. It will help your site never lose any old backlinks and SEO. You can choose any page to have any extension. Choices are: .html, .htm, .php, .xml, .shtml and .asp. If you don't pick an extension then it will just default to no extension.

Unlike other similar plugins, this one allows you to choose the extension with no pre-determined options. And you can change it anytime. This is particularly handy if you manage multiple sites since you can use the same plugin on all of them.
