# WP Page Permalink Extension

This plugin helps to change WordPress Page Permalinks structure, which is not customizable by default.

## Description

Converting an old HTML, PHP, or ASP site to WordPress? WP Page Extension will let you create pages inside of WordPress and give them an extension you want. It will help your site never lose any old backlinks and SEO. You can choose any page to have any extension. Choices are: .html, .htm, .php, .xml, .shtml and .asp. If you don't pick an extension then it will just default to no extension.
